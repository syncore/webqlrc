Web remote control (rcon) for Quake Live using websockets/zeromq

*Disclaimer: I consider this a toy, test project. Emphasis on **test**! It was developed primarily at a Starbucks in October 2015 as a quick proof of concept and as an excuse to play with the Go programming language (also, I wanted to learn about WebSockets). Not feature complete and needs heavy refactoring, which may or may not be performed at a later date.*
